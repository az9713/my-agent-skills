# window-os-skills

Three personal skills for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), plus an example audit report showing the skill-best-practices auditor in action.

## Skills

### windows-desktop

Control the Windows desktop through PowerShell commands. Covers 16 operation categories — window management, app launching, screenshots, volume control, system info, network info, file browsing, virtual desktops, clipboard, keyboard/mouse input, notifications, and more.

All file and directory operations are **strictly read-only**. The skill enforces a comprehensive prohibited-commands list that blocks file writes, process kills, shutdowns, registry writes, service control, network changes, firewall rules, and scheduled tasks. The only file-creation exception is screenshots (saved to `%TEMP%`).

**Files:**
- `SKILL.md` — Safety rules, operation category overview, quick-reference PowerShell snippets, common mistakes
- `powershell-reference.md` — Full command reference for all 16 categories with copy-paste-ready snippets (569 lines)

### plugin-skill-auditor

Inventory all personal Claude Code skills and plugin marketplaces, create a full backup, and generate a comprehensive report with exact removal and restoration instructions for every item.

This skill is **audit and backup only** — it never deletes, removes, or modifies anything. It scans `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/`, `~/.claude/plugins/cache/`, and `~/.claude/settings.json`, then writes an `AUDIT-REPORT.md` with per-item removal commands, restoration commands, a nuclear-option cleanup script, and a full restoration procedure.

**Files:**
- `SKILL.md` — Scope definition, 5-step execution procedure, report section templates, safety constraints

### skill-best-practices

Audit installed Claude Code skills against a 25-check best-practices checklist and output ranked findings to the terminal. Accepts an optional skill name or audits all personal skills by default.

The 25 checks are organized by severity:

| Severity | Checks | Points each | What they catch |
|----------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Critical (C01-C04) | 4 | 8 | Missing SKILL.md, missing frontmatter, missing `name`/`description` |
| High (H01-H06) | 6 | 4 | No "Use when" triggers in description, SKILL.md over 500 lines, unreferenced files, invalid name format, folder/name mismatch |
| Medium (M01-M10) | 10 | 2 | No `allowed-tools`, verbose body without `references/`, extraneous docs, non-standard frontmatter fields, deep nesting, missing TOC in long references, side-effect skills without safety flags |
| Low (L01-L05) | 5 | 1 | Passive voice, description length, missing common-mistakes section, keyword stuffing |

Scores are calculated as earned points out of 81 maximum (Critical=32 + High=24 + Medium=20 + Low=5).

**Where the best practices come from:**
1. [Anthropic's official Claude Code skills documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) — file format, supported frontmatter fields, directory conventions, progressive disclosure pattern
2. Anthropic's `skill-creator` guide (from the `anthropic-agent-skills` marketplace) — Claude Search Optimization (CSO), description writing, naming conventions, token efficiency

**Files:**
- `SKILL.md` — Execution steps, output format specification, edge cases
- `references/checklist.md` — All 25 checks with IDs, detection logic, fix recommendations, and scoring weights

## Outputs

### outputs/skill-audit-report.md

A sample audit report generated by running `skill-best-practices` against 15 personal skills. Each skill gets a detailed table showing every check as PASS or FAIL, with fix recommendations for failures. The report ends with:

- **Summary table** — per-skill fail counts by severity and weighted score percentage
- **Stats** — 15 skills audited, 93% average score, 0 critical failures, 1 perfect score (windows-desktop at 100%)
- **Issue frequency** — M01 (no `allowed-tools` restriction) was the most common issue, affecting 10 of 15 skills
- **Scoring methodology** — weighted point system explained

## Installation

Copy the skills you want into your personal skills directory:

```bash
# All three
cp -r .claude/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/

# Or individually
cp -r .claude/skills/windows-desktop ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r .claude/skills/plugin-skill-auditor ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r .claude/skills/skill-best-practices ~/.claude/skills/
```

Restart Claude Code for the skills to take effect.

## Usage

Skills activate automatically when Claude detects a matching request, or can be invoked directly:

```
/windows-desktop          # Activates for Windows desktop operations
/plugin-skill-auditor     # Backup and audit all skills/plugins
/skill-best-practices     # Audit all skills against best practices
/skill-best-practices windows-desktop   # Audit a single skill
```
